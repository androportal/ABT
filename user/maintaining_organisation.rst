	+ On selecting ``Change server location`` , it prompts a dialog to enter IP address manually. 
	  It requires a live internet connection, it can be within an organisation
	  or an institute. User can access a centralized remote server running within 
  	  the institute. The advantage is, each user will have his/her own 
  	  account on the server. The central server runs Postgres as a database engine.
