Rollover
========
Go to ``Master menu`` > ``Rollover``.

When the user click on ``Rollover``, it will check for the following conditions:

* If ``financial period`` is not completed then, it prompts for ``can not rollover,
  since financial year is not completed!!!``.

* If the financial year has finished, it promts ``rollover has been done``. 

* Rollover will be done only once in a financial period so , if you click on 
  it, again it prompts ``rollover has done already!!!``
