* A list of ``bank account`` names will be populated. The user selects
  one of the account names displayed and gives the ``from date`` and
  ``to date`` i.e the time period. By default it is organisation's
  financial from date and to date.  Change date as per the
  requirement.
      
* Check the first check box to view ``cleared+uncleared`` transactions
  and second one to view transactions with ``narrations``.
  	  
* Press ``View``.

* A Ledger for that period for the selected account will be displayed
  to the user with the fields: Date, Particulars, Cheque number,
  Reference Number, Debit Amount, Credit Amount, Clearance date &
  Memo. This shall consist all the reconciled transactions with the
  clearance date and not-reconciled transactions along with all
  not-reconciled transactions from the start of the organisation (i.e
  start date of the company) to the entered ``to date``.

* ``Total Debit`` & ``Total Credit`` are displayed in the last row of
  the table.
	    	
* Bank Reconciliation Statement is located at the bottom of the table.
  
* If the user wishes to reconcile now, he clicks the ``Clearance
  date`` column.  The clearance date field and memo are the ``Text
  input`` areas for the user to enter valid data.
  
* The user enters the date and some text in the memo (if he wishes to)
  and clicks on ``Save`` button(located at the title bar).
  
* There are 3 conditions to decide if the transaction has to be
  reconciled or not.

  **Condition 1:** If clearance date has been entered and memo field
  is empty, the transaction is cleared i.e reconciled.  
  **Condition 2:** If clearance date has NOT been entered by the user, 
  then, this transaction will be reconciled in the future.

  On clicking ``Save``, the transactions which fall into Condition 1
  will be the only ones which will be reconciled.

* So the ``Bank Reconciliation Statement`` will get updated
  automatically.
   
* Click on the table row to see the details of the transaction. In
  accounting terms this fuctionality is called ``Drilldown``.
   
* In options menu two features are provided: export report in PDF or
  CSV format.

* To change the input informations, user can click on button present
  in top-left corner of the screen.
