* The journal entry has been designed with user-friendliness in mind, with a 
  default chart of accounts as a starting point. However, you have to create 
  at least two accounts to start any transaction. It also offers every 
  opportunity for creating your own user-defined variations.


* Select the mode of transaction from the list of voucher type. ``Mode`` of transaction 
  can be Contra, Journal, Payment, Receipt, Debit Note, Credit Note, Sales, 
  Sales Return, Purchase, Purchase Return.

* Voucher Date - date on which the transaction is happened.

* **Note**: ABT sets financial date as Voucher date, if no transaction is recorded before.

  of the respective voucher type. If the date is changed, it updates the bydefault date or previous 
  date with the new date.

  in mind. This module is also closely integrated with other modules in the 
  program. The Project register can be opened by going to Ledger -Select 
  project name- View.

  closing balances for both the account name. Debit balance are highlighted 
  in Green color and Credit balances are highlighted in Red color.

  a journal item in journal entry, the setting will guide you to the correct 
  field. This is set based on the Accounting Principles, ``Debit what comes in; 
  credit what goes out, Debit the receiver; Credit the Giver, Debit All 
  Expenses and losses; Credit all incomes and gains``.
